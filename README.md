# Project - JavaScript Blog - Static Page

This project has been completed as a part of JavaScript Front-end Bootcamp @ Kodilla.
Project utilises clean JavaScript and templating library Handlebars. During thhe project I have learned how to work with DOM objects, apply templates and render changes on pages.

The ineractive page includes tag cloud (depending on quantity of articles connected with keywords it will increase or decrease in size). Tags enable the page to filter displayed articles.
